# Advancing Ensemble Learning Models for Residential Building Electricity Consumption Forecasting\n\nWelcome to the repository accompanying our paper: **"Advancing Ensemble Learning Models for Residential Building Electricity Consumption Forecasting"** by **J. Moon et al., 2024**. This repository provides the datasets and code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the paper and to facilitate further research in the field of residential building electricity consumption forecasting.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccurate forecasting of electricity consumption in residential buildings is crucial for energy management and planning. In our work, we advance ensemble learning models to improve the prediction accuracy of electricity consumption. We also employ Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret the models, providing insights into the factors influencing energy usage.\n\nThis repository contains:\n\n- **Datasets**: Two comprehensive datasets for residential building electricity consumption forecasting.\n- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks implementing ensemble learning models and deep learning models, along with XAI analyses.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nPLoS_ONE/\n├── Appliances Energy Prediction.csv\n├── University Residential Complex.csv\n├── ensemble_models_notebook.ipynb\n├── deep_learning_energy_prediction.ipynb\n├── explainable_AI_energy_consumption_models.ipynb\n├── README.md\n```\n\n- The previous folders (`code`, `data`, `predict`) can be ignored as they have been replaced with updated datasets and notebooks.\n\n## Datasets\n\nThe datasets used in our study are included in this repository:\n\n1. **Appliances Energy Prediction.csv**\n   - **Description**: Contains energy consumption data from household appliances.
